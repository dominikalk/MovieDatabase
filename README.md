# MovieDatabase
This web app uses the React library and was made in the second half of my work experience placement in october 2019. It uses the TMDb (the movie data base) API. It is a IMDB like web app.

It was made in a short amount of time so it is not designed to work on mobile devices but should work on computers well.

To run the program open the command line inside the folder and type: 

```

npm install
npm start

```
